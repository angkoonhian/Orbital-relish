<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<h2>Motivation:</h2>
<p>Our project aims to recruit stay-home chefs, be it aspiring teenagers who want to dabble in cooking or stay-home spouses that want to showcase their ethnic cuisine, and to connect these chefs to a wider customer base that would rather home-cooked food rather than what is readily available out there now.
Especially during these trying times where people are under strict quarantine, local businesses and hawkers who have to close their physical store will be able to continue business from home. Even if the hawkers choose to stay open, business is affected by the low traffic and delivery services require a commission fee of 30-35% per order. According to local hawker and founder of Hawker Dabao United Melvin Chew, hawkers are suffering a loss of 70% during this pandemic. Our project could help customers that want to support local businesses but are fearful of leaving the home as well as the stores themselves.
</p>
<h2>Aim:</h2>
<p>A food delivery service that uses an Android application and a website to connect nearby customers to stay-home cooks.</p>
